## Python (written in 2013)

(`/python`) A simple data parser script

## Perl (written in 2015)

## Miscellaneous

* (2018) I wrote a DomCode raffler in [Rexx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rexx): https://github.com/domcode/rafflers/blob/master/rexx-jkva/raffler.rexx
* (2018) I wrote a DomCode raffler in [Rakudo Perl6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakudo): https://github.com/domcode/rafflers/blob/master/rakudo-perl6-jkva/raffler.p6 -- I think it's the shortest raffler in the list.
